I'm a data enthusiast with a love for all things Python. Whether it's cleaning datasets, visualizing them, building predictive models, or deploying machine learning algorithms, I'm always eager to explore new data-driven solutions.

I enjoy digging into the math of the algorithms and techniques that power data science. But I also know the importance of practical applications and making ideas accessible to a wider audience.
